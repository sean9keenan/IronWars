A Geometry wars clone written in Lua using LÖVE

##Gameplay
There are 12 levels, this game is currently designed to be played with 5 people on XBOX controllers.

Pick up items, where the color of the item corresponds to the color button to press in order to use the item.

If you want to skip a level, hit the key corresponding to that level number, or "z", "x" for levels 11 and 12.

AWSD and arrow keys can be used to control all ships for debugging

##Requirements
You need to have LÖVE installed, specifically LÖVE 0.8.0 other versions WILL NOT WORK.
